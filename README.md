#XPS visualizer and converter

__by Nikolay Falaleev__

This app was developed to make it easier to convert .xy files from X-ray Photoelectron spectrometer PHOIBOS analyzer (SpecsLab Software) to .csv, calculate cumulative spectrum from a batch of channels and save only the desired region of interest.

The most recent app release is available [online](https://nikolasent.shinyapps.io/XPS_visualizer_and_converter/) as a Shiny app.

Some examples of input files are included in the "example" directory.
